## About Us

The PokeDream Network is a Pixelmon community here to create a welcoming and immersive world for everyone to enjoy and feel at home. What makes this project so special is that we are open about our policies and actively seek feedback. If you are ready to join this amazing community, we invite you to read through our [wiki](http://github.com/PokeDream/Server/wiki) for information about how to join the server and be sure to check out our rules as well.

## Core Values

This project is built on the foundation of three core values.

* Stability
> A smooth playing experience is preferred over being the most feature packed server. As such, one of our biggest priorities is ensuring that the server is lag-free.

* Community
> This friendly and close-knit community is very important to us. We are always looking for new ways to bring the community closer through events and fun activities.

* Dreams
> The name of this server was created to represent the ultimate purpose behind this passion project. To build a Pixelmon community from our wildest dreams.
